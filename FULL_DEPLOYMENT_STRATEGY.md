# 🚀 Full Scientific Package Deployment Strategy

## 📋 **Current Status**

✅ **Minimal Deployment**: App running with core packages  
🎯 **Goal**: Enable `py21cmfast`, `tools21cm`, `bagpipes`, `jwst_pipeline`

---

## ⚡ **Quick Deployment (Recommended)**

### **Step 1: Replace Requirements File**

```bash
# Backup current minimal version
cp requirements.txt requirements-minimal-backup.txt

# Use full scientific requirements
cp requirements-full.txt requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Replace System Packages**

```bash
# Backup current minimal packages
cp packages.txt packages-minimal-backup.txt

# Use full system packages
cp packages-full.txt packages.txt
```

### **Step 3: Commit and Deploy**

```bash
git add requirements.txt packages.txt
git commit -m "🔬 Enable full scientific packages: py21cmfast, bagpipes, jwst, tools21cm"
git push
```

---

## ⏱️ **Expected Deployment Time**

- **Minimal Version**: 2-3 minutes ✅ (Current)
- **Full Version**: 10-15 minutes ⏳ (Target)

**Why longer?** Heavy packages like `jwst` (500MB+) and `py21cmfast` need compilation.

---

## 🧪 **Package-by-Package Testing (Conservative)**

If full deployment fails, try adding packages gradually:

### **Phase 1: Add Corner Plots**

```txt
# Add to requirements.txt
corner==2.2.1
```

### **Phase 2: Add SED Fitting**

```txt
# Add to requirements.txt
bagpipes>=1.0.0
cython>=0.29.0
```

### **Phase 3: Add 21cm Cosmology**

```txt
# Add to packages.txt
libfftw3-dev
libgsl-dev
build-essential

# Add to requirements.txt
git+https://github.com/21cmfast/21cmFAST.git
tools21cm>=2.0.0
```

### **Phase 4: Add JWST Pipeline**

```txt
# Add to packages.txt
libcfitsio-dev

# Add to requirements.txt
jwst>=1.12.0
```

## 🛠️ **System Requirements Breakdown**

| Package          | System Dependencies                             | Purpose                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `21cmFAST` (git) | `libfftw3-dev`, `libgsl-dev`, `build-essential` | Latest 21cm simulations |
| `tools21cm`      | Same as py21cmfast                              | 21cm analysis utilities |
| `bagpipes`       | `build-essential`, `gfortran`                   | SED fitting             |
| `jwst`           | `libcfitsio-dev`                                | JWST pipeline           |
| `corner`         | (minimal dependencies)                          | Corner plots            |

## 🚨 **Fallback Plan**

If full deployment fails:

1. **Revert to minimal**:

   ```bash
   cp requirements-minimal-backup.txt requirements.txt
   cp packages-minimal-backup.txt packages.txt
   git add . && git commit -m "Revert to minimal for stability"
   git push
   ```

2. **Use staged approach**: Deploy packages one by one using Phase 1-4 above

## 📊 **Feature Status After Full Deployment**

| Module           | Minimal Version | Full Version                    |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Cosmic Evolution | Mock/Demo data  | Full py21cmfast simulations     |
| Cluster Analyzer | Basic analysis  | Advanced environmental modeling |
| JWST Pipeline    | Fallback mode   | Real JWST data processing       |
| SED Fitting      | Simple models   | Full Bagpipes fitting           |
| AI Insights      | ✅ Available    | ✅ Enhanced with real data      |

## 🎯 **Recommendation**

**Try the Quick Deployment first!** Streamlit Cloud has improved significantly and can often handle the full scientific stack. The app is designed with graceful fallbacks, so even if some packages fail, core functionality remains available.
