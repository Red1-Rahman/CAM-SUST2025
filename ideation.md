**Project Title:**  
SEDs of Cluster Galaxies: Environmental Quenching

**Concept Overview:**  
This project examines how cluster galaxies differ from field galaxies in stellar mass, star-formation rate, age, and dust content. Cluster membership will be determined using redshift and positional data and Bagpipes SED fitting will be applied to photometry. The results will test whether dense environments accelerate quenching compared to the field ones.

Timeframe: ~2-3 weeks
Possible Paper Angle: “Star-formation suppression in cluster environments at intermediate redshifts”

**Inspired By Session(s):**  
Session 2 and Session 4 (Galaxy SEDs Fitting.ipynb, galaxy_clusters_workshop_notebook_Participants.ipynb)

Project Title:
From a baby universe to Galactic Ocean (Name suggestion Cos-Evo)

**Concept Overview:**  
by using 21 cm cosmology we could model the early universe , then from that early universe how galaxys are formed who could describe by galaxy's morphology and very lasy by using Begpipes could show some galaxy related SED

**Inspired By Session(s):**  
Session 1 and 2

**Project Title:**  
**Tracing Star Formation Histories with JWST & Bagpipes**

**Concept Overview:**  
By using **JWST NIRSpec data**, we can analyze spectra of galaxies and fit them with **Bagpipes** to measure **star-formation rates, stellar masses, metallicities, and ages**. This will allow us to **reconstruct how galaxies formed and evolved their stars over time** and examine how environment affects star formation.

**Inspired By Session(s):**  
**Session 2** and **Session 3** (JWST NIRSpec & Bagpipes)
