From a baby universe to Galactic Ocean 
**Concept Overview:**  
by using 21 cm cosmology we could model the early universe , then from that early universe how galaxys are formed who could describe by galaxy's morphology and very lasy by using Begpipes could show some galaxy related SED

**Inspired By Session(s):**  
Session 1 and 2
